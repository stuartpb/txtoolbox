## About
This is a collection of [Lua](http://lua.org) scripts for quick-and-easy string manipulation.

## Running
Obviously, you'll need Lua to run these scripts. To run the scripts ending in .wlua, you'll need the [IUPLua](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/) library.

On Windows, you can get all this and more by installing [Lua for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/downloads/detail?name=LuaForWindows_v5.1.4-40.exe).

Outside of Windows, check your local package manager (which will most likely have packages for Lua- in fact, it's in the base install for Arch Linux) and/or Sourceforge (there are some good tips out there for setting up the files you can get from Sourceforge if you search for them).
